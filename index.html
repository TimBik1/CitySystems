            <p>In New York City, tackling rising air pollution and mitigating bacterial spread in public spaces are crucial for improving public health. The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has emerged as a significant ally in this battle. The literature from Manx Tech Group and NCBI illustrates how real-time monitoring of air quality, facilitated by IoT, enables prompt interventions to curb pollution (Manx Tech Group 2023; NCBI Article). The envisioned smart cities, underpinned by data-driven environmental management, are a leap towards better living conditions. Nonetheless, a centralized management system is essential for effective pollution forecasting, as stressed in the NCBI article. Accompanying data bar graphs on the website will further depict the positive trajectory in the city's health metrics, underscoring the beneficial impact of IoT in enhancing urban health and safety.</p>
